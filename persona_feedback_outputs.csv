1,critic,"School uniforms should be banned because students need freedom to express themselves, but some people think uniforms help with discipline and focus. I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","1. Clarity: The paragraph mixes two opposing views in one sentence, which makes it confusing. Instead of combining “students need freedom” and “some people think uniforms help discipline” in one sentence, separate these ideas clearly. Also, the phrase “it does not always improve behaviour” is vague—specify what “it” refers to (uniforms) and explain why.

2. Structure: The paragraph lacks a clear topic sentence and supporting details. Start with a clear topic sentence stating your main argument (e.g., “School uniforms should be banned because they restrict students’ self-expression and do not guarantee better behaviour.”). Then, add at least two sentences explaining why uniforms are unfair and ineffective, with examples or reasoning.

3. Strength of argument: The paragraph states opinions but does not provide reasons or evidence. Explain why uniforms make students uncomfortable (e.g., lack of individuality) and why they fail to improve behaviour (e.g., studies or logical reasoning). This will make your argument more convincing.

4. Suggestions for improvement: Rewrite the paragraph to have a clear topic sentence, separate opposing views into different sentences, and provide specific reasons supporting your opinion. For example, explain how uniforms limit freedom and why discipline is not necessarily improved. Adding examples or evidence will strengthen your argument.","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement. Feedback should be specific enough that the student can edit the paragraph after reading it."
1,explainer,"School uniforms should be banned because students need freedom to express themselves, but some people think uniforms help with discipline and focus. I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","Here is feedback you can use to improve your paragraph:

1. Clarity:
- Your main idea is clear: you believe school uniforms should be banned because they are unfair and don’t always help behavior.
- To make it clearer, try to state your opinion in one strong sentence at the beginning. For example: “I believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students’ freedom and do not improve behavior.”
- Avoid vague phrases like “some people think” without explaining why they think that.

2. Structure:
- Your paragraph has two ideas: freedom of expression and uniforms not improving behavior. These are good points but they feel a bit mixed together.
- Try to organize your paragraph with one main idea per sentence. For example:
  - Sentence 1: State your opinion clearly.
  - Sentence 2: Explain why students need freedom to express themselves.
  - Sentence 3: Explain why uniforms do not always improve behavior.
- This will make your paragraph easier to follow.

3. Strength of argument:
- You mention uniforms help discipline and focus but don’t explain why some people think that or why you disagree.
- Add a sentence that briefly explains the other side’s view, for example: “Supporters say uniforms help students focus by reducing distractions.”
- Then explain why you disagree with evidence or examples: “However, many students feel uncomfortable and distracted when forced to wear the same clothes.”
- Adding examples or reasons makes your argument stronger.

4. Suggestions for improvement:
- Rewrite your topic sentence to clearly state your opinion.
- Separate your ideas into clear sentences.
- Add a sentence explaining the opposing view.
- Add reasons or examples to support your opinion.
- For example, you could add: “For instance, some students may feel anxious or unhappy if they cannot wear clothes that reflect their personality.”

After revising, your paragraph might look like this:

“I believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students’ freedom to express themselves and do not always improve behavior. Students need to wear clothes that show their personality and help them feel comfortable. Supporters of uniforms say they help students focus by reducing distractions. However, many students feel uncomfortable and distracted when forced to wear the same clothes. For instance, some students may feel anxious or unhappy if they cannot wear clothes that reflect their personality.”

Try these changes and your paragraph will be clearer, better organized, and more convincing!","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement. Feedback should be specific enough that the student can edit the paragraph after reading it."
1,supporter,"School uniforms should be banned because students need freedom to express themselves, but some people think uniforms help with discipline and focus. I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","You’ve done a great job stating your opinion clearly and acknowledging the opposing view, which makes your paragraph balanced and thoughtful. Your main reasons—freedom of expression and comfort—are important and relatable points.

To improve clarity, try to make your sentences more precise. For example, instead of “not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing,” you could say “many students feel uncomfortable and restricted by wearing identical uniforms.” This makes your point stronger and clearer.

For structure, consider separating your ideas into two sentences: one that explains why uniforms should be banned (freedom and comfort) and another that addresses why some people support uniforms (discipline and focus). This will help your paragraph flow better.

To strengthen your argument, add a specific example or explanation of how uniforms fail to improve behavior or limit self-expression. For instance, you could mention how students express their personalities through clothing or how discomfort can distract from learning.

Here’s a quick revision suggestion:
“School uniforms should be banned because many students feel uncomfortable and restricted by wearing identical clothing, which limits their freedom to express themselves. Although some people believe uniforms help with discipline and focus, uniforms do not always improve behavior and can even distract students who feel constrained.”

Keep up the good work! With these changes, your paragraph will be clearer, better organized, and more convincing.","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement.

I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","Here is some feedback to help you improve your paragraph:

1. Clarity:
- Your main idea is that school uniforms should be banned because they limit students' freedom and do not always improve behavior. Make this clearer by stating your opinion at the very beginning.
- Avoid mixing opposing views and your opinion in the same sentence. This can confuse the reader.

2. Structure:
- Start with a clear topic sentence that states your position.
- Then, explain your reasons one by one in separate sentences.
- Finally, briefly acknowledge the opposing view and explain why you disagree.

3. Strength of argument:
- You mention that uniforms do not always improve behavior, but you could strengthen this by giving a specific example or explaining why.
- Also, explain why freedom of expression is important for students.

4. Suggestions for improvement:
- Rewrite your paragraph with this order: your clear opinion → reason 1 (freedom to express) → reason 2 (discomfort wearing the same thing) → counterargument (discipline and focus) → why you disagree.
- Add more detail or examples to support your points.
- Use transition words like “first,” “however,” and “therefore” to improve flow.

Example revision:
""I believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students’ freedom to express themselves. First, wearing the same clothes every day can make students feel uncomfortable and prevent them from showing their unique personalities. Second, uniforms do not always improve behavior, as some students may still act out regardless of what they wear. Although some people argue that uniforms help with discipline and focus, I disagree because true discipline comes from personal responsibility, not clothing.""","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement.

1,combined,"School uniforms should be banned because students need freedom to express themselves, but some people think uniforms help with discipline and focus. I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","Here is some clear, structured feedback to help you improve your paragraph:

1. **State Your Opinion Clearly at the Start**  
   Begin with a strong topic sentence that clearly expresses your main idea. For example:  
   *“I believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students’ freedom to express themselves and do not always improve behavior.”*

2. **Organize Your Ideas into Separate Sentences**  
   Break your paragraph into clear points:  
   - Explain why freedom of expression matters to students.  
   - Describe how uniforms can make students feel uncomfortable or restricted.  
   - Acknowledge the opposing view that uniforms help with discipline and focus.  
   - Explain why you disagree with that view, using reasons or examples.

3. **Support Your Arguments with Reasons or Examples**  
   Make your points stronger by adding explanations or specific examples, such as:  
   - How wearing the same clothes every day can prevent students from showing their personalities.  
   - Why discomfort from uniforms might distract students rather than help them behave better.  
   - Why discipline depends more on personal responsibility than on clothing.

4. **Use Clear and Precise Language**  
   Replace vague phrases like “some people think” or “it does not always improve behaviour” with specific explanations. For example, say “many students feel uncomfortable wearing identical uniforms” or “uniforms do not guarantee better behavior because students may still misbehave regardless of their clothes.”

5. **Improve Flow with Transition Words**  
   Use words like “first,” “however,” and “therefore” to connect your ideas smoothly and guide the reader through your argument.

2,critic,"Climate change is getting worse and many countries still burn fossil fuels even though they know it is harmful. Governments talk about action but real changes are slow. People recycle and try to reduce waste, but it feels small compared to what big companies do.","1. Clarity: The paragraph contains vague phrases like ""getting worse,"" ""talk about action,"" and ""feels small."" Replace these with precise descriptions or examples to make your points clearer. For example, specify how climate change is worsening or what kind of actions governments discuss.

2. Structure: The paragraph lacks a clear topic sentence and logical flow. Begin with a strong topic sentence that states your main argument. Then, organize your ideas so that each sentence builds on the previous one, moving from the problem (climate change and fossil fuel use) to responses (government actions and individual efforts).

3. Strength of argument: The paragraph makes general claims without evidence or explanation. For instance, explain why government changes are slow or how individual recycling efforts compare to corporate actions. Adding specific examples or data will strengthen your argument.

4. Suggestions for improvement: Rewrite the paragraph to start with a clear topic sentence. Use more precise language and provide examples or explanations to support your claims. Consider adding a concluding sentence that summarizes your point or suggests a solution. For example, mention a specific policy that governments have delayed or a major polluting company to illustrate your points.","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement.

2,explainer,"Climate change is getting worse and many countries still burn fossil fuels even though they know it is harmful. Governments talk about action but real changes are slow. People recycle and try to reduce waste, but it feels small compared to what big companies do.","Here is detailed feedback based on your paragraph and the rubric:

1. Clarity:
- Your ideas are clear but a bit general. Try to be more specific about what you mean by “getting worse” and “real changes are slow.”
- Example: Instead of “Climate change is getting worse,” you could say “Global temperatures have risen by 1.2 degrees Celsius in the past century, causing more extreme weather.”

2. Structure:
- Your paragraph has a basic structure but could be improved by grouping similar ideas together and using transition words.
- For example, start with the problem (climate change and fossil fuels), then discuss government actions, then individual actions, and finally the gap between efforts.
- Use transition words like “however,” “although,” or “despite” to connect ideas smoothly.

3. Strength of Argument:
- Your argument is that individual efforts feel small compared to big companies, but you don’t provide examples or evidence.
- Add a specific example or fact, such as “Big companies are responsible for nearly 70% of global carbon emissions, which makes individual recycling efforts seem less impactful.”
- This will make your argument stronger and more convincing.

4. Suggestions for Improvement:
- Add specific facts or statistics to support your points.
- Use transition words to improve flow.
- Clarify vague phrases by explaining them or giving examples.
- Consider ending with a sentence that suggests a solution or calls for stronger action.

Revised example paragraph:

Climate change is becoming more severe, with global temperatures rising by 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last century, leading to extreme weather events. Despite knowing this, many countries continue to burn fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases. Governments often talk about taking action; however, real policy changes and reductions in emissions have been slow. While individuals recycle and try to reduce waste, these efforts seem small compared to the impact of big companies, which are responsible for nearly 70% of global carbon emissions. To effectively combat climate change, stronger regulations on corporations and increased global cooperation are necessary.

2,supporter,"Climate change is getting worse and many countries still burn fossil fuels even though they know it is harmful. Governments talk about action but real changes are slow. People recycle and try to reduce waste, but it feels small compared to what big companies do.","You’ve made a strong start by clearly stating the problem of climate change and pointing out different groups’ roles, which helps the reader understand the issue. Your ideas flow logically from the global level (countries and governments) to individuals, which gives your paragraph a clear structure.

To improve your paragraph, try these steps:

1. **Increase clarity by adding specific examples or details.** For instance, mention a particular country or company to make your points more concrete and persuasive.

2. **Strengthen your argument by explaining why government actions are slow or why individual efforts feel small.** This will help the reader understand the challenges better.

3. **Improve sentence variety and transitions.** Instead of starting multiple sentences with “People” or “Governments,” vary your sentence openings and use connecting words like “however” or “although” to make your writing smoother.

After revising, your paragraph might include clearer examples, more explanation, and smoother flow, making your argument more compelling.

2,planner,"Climate change is getting worse and many countries still burn fossil fuels even though they know it is harmful. Governments talk about action but real changes are slow. People recycle and try to reduce waste, but it feels small compared to what big companies do.","Here is some feedback you can use to improve your paragraph:

1. Clarity:
- Your main idea is clear: climate change is worsening and actions to stop it are insufficient. However, some sentences could be clearer. For example, “Governments talk about action but real changes are slow” could be more specific by explaining what kind of actions or changes you mean.
- Try to avoid vague phrases like “it feels small” and instead explain why individual actions seem less impactful.

2. Structure:
- The paragraph would be stronger if you organized it logically. Start with the problem (climate change getting worse), then explain the causes (countries burning fossil fuels), followed by the responses (government talks and individual efforts), and end with your conclusion or opinion.
- Each sentence should connect smoothly to the next. For example, after mentioning fossil fuels, explain why governments’ slow changes matter, then discuss individual efforts.

3. Strength of argument:
- You make good points, but your argument would be stronger with examples or evidence. For instance, name some countries still heavily reliant on fossil fuels or mention specific government policies that are slow to change.
- Explain why individual actions like recycling are not enough compared to big companies. This will make your argument more convincing.

4. Suggestions for improvement:
- Revise the paragraph to follow this order: state the worsening climate change problem, identify the main causes, describe government and individual responses, and conclude with why more action is needed.
- Add specific examples or facts to support your points.
- Use clearer language and avoid vague expressions.
- Try combining some sentences to improve flow, for example: “Although many countries still burn fossil fuels despite knowing the harm, government actions to reduce this are slow, and individual efforts like recycling seem small compared to the impact of big companies.”

With these changes, your paragraph will be clearer, better organized, and more persuasive.","Focus on four aspects: clarity, structure, strength of argument, and suggestions for improvement. Feedback should be specific enough that the student can edit the paragraph after reading it."
